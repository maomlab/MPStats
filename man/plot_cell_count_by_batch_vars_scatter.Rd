\title{plot cell count by batch variables as a scatterplot}
\usage{
plot_cell_count_by_batch_vars_scatter(well_scores, subtitle = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{well_scores}{tibble::tibble as output by read_well_scores}

\item{subtitle}{plot subtitle, typically the study identifier}
}
\value{
ggplot2 object with the lattice plot with a panel for each batch variable
}
\description{
For each batch variable, show a facet panel with sqrt(cell_count) by batch variable
}
\details{
#' Modeling the cell count as a poisson random variable, taking the square root makes the
distribution more normal.
